# RmdTextureFix
A program for fixing textures in rmd models.

# Introduction
This program was made for the purpose of fixing custom textures inside of rmd model files.<br>
Textures imported in a certain way tend to have broken shadows in game:

This program takes a PAC\RMD file (or a directory with them) and fixes textures inside of it.<br>
# Usage
Simply drag n drop (or use the terminal) an RMD,PAC or even a directory containing them and they will get overwritten with files that have fully working textures.
